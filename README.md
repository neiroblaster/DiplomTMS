___
> ### The goal of this project is that non-native speakers should **learn English** by listening to their favorite songs by adding the link from YouTube alongside the lyrics of the chosen song.

>> ### **Audition** then dynamically removes different words from the song so that you could fill in the gaps accordingly.

>> ### After that, it checks your answers and provides you with the correct options in case there are any mistakes.
