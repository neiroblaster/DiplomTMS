<h3>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is that non-native speakers should learn English by listening to their favorite songs by adding the link from YouTube alongside the lyrics of the chosen song.
</h3>

<h3>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audition then dynamically removes different words from the song so that you could fill in the gaps accordingly.
