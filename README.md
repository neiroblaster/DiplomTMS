+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is that non-native speakers should <b>learn English</b> by listening to their favorite songs by adding the link from YouTube alongside the lyrics of the chosen song.

+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Audition</b> then dynamically removes different words from the song so that you could fill in the gaps accordingly.
